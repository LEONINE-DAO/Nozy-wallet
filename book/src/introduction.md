# Introduction

## What is NozyWallet?

**NozyWallet** is a privacy-first Zcash wallet that enforces complete transaction privacy by default. Unlike other Zcash wallets, NozyWallet **only supports shielded transactions** - making it functionally equivalent to Monero in terms of privacy, but with faster block times and lower fees. "Cyberpunk," describing activists, coders, and thinkers who advocate for strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to enable social and political change — basically, using code to protect individual freedom from surveillance by governments or corporations.



### Monero-Level Privacy, Zcash Speed

NozyWallet combines the best of both worlds:
- **Privacy**: Every transaction is private by default (like Monero)
- **Speed**: Fast block times and instant settlements (like Zcash)
- **Security**: Self-custodial with enterprise-grade encryption
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use for both beginners and experts

## Privacy Guarantees

When you use NozyWallet, you get:

- ✅ **Every transaction is private** - No transparent transactions possible
- ✅ **Untraceable** - Sender, receiver, and amount are all hidden
- ✅ **Fungible** - No blacklisted or tainted coins
- ✅ **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Cryptographically proven privacy
- ✅ **Privacy by default** - You cannot accidentally compromise your privacy

## Why Choose NozyWallet?

### For Privacy-Conscious Users

If you value financial privacy and want to ensure your transactions remain private, NozyWallet is the perfect choice. You don't have to remember to use "shielded" addresses - every transaction is automatically private.

### For Speed and Efficiency

Zcash's Orchard protocol provides faster block times than Monero, meaning your transactions confirm faster while maintaining the same level of privacy.
