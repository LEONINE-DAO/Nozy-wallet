# Introduction

NozyWallet is a **privacy-first Zcash wallet** that supports **only shielded (Orchard) transactions**—so every send and receive is private by default.

For the full picture—what Nozy is, why it exists, and how it’s designed—read the **Nozy** section chapter by chapter:

- **[What is Nozy?](nozy/what-is-nozy.md)** — One-sentence definition and why it exists
- **[Purpose](nozy/purpose.md)** — What Nozy is for (and not for)
- **[Identity](nozy/identity.md)** — What Nozy is and isn’t
- **[Philosophy](nozy/philosophy.md)** — Design principles
- **[Privacy model](nozy/privacy-model.md)** — How privacy works in practice

Then head to [Getting Started](getting-started/installation.md) to install and create your first wallet.
