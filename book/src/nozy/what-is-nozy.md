# What is Nozy?

***

NozyWallet is a privacy-first Zcash wallet built for the Orchard protocol. It focuses on making every transaction private by default and removing the choice—or the mistake—of using transparent addresses.

#### In one sentence

NozyWallet is the first Zcash wallet designed around Zebra, with shielded-only transactions and no transparent support—Monero-level privacy with Zcash shield.

***

#### Why it exists

Most Zcash wallets support both transparent and shielded transactions. That flexibility means users can accidentally leak information. Nozy removes that risk: you cannot send or receive on transparent addresses. The chain sees only valid, private activity.

***

#### What you get

- **Shielded-only** — Every send and receive uses Orchard; no transparent t-addresses.
- **Zebra-native** — Built to talk to a Zebra RPC node (no lightwalletd required).
- **Self-custodial** — Keys and seeds stay on your device; the server never sees them.
- **Multi-surface** — Desktop (Tauri), CLI, and mobile (React Native) with a shared API server.
