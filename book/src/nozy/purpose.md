# Purpose

***

The blockchain is transparent by default. Most wallets mirror that: they show balances, addresses, and history in the open and leave privacy as an option for nozy people.

Nozy does the opposite. It assumes privacy is the goal and enforces it.

#### What Nozy is for

Its purpose is to give you a Zcash wallet where:

- **Privacy is default** — You don’t have to “remember” to use shielded; it’s the only option.
- **Mistakes are hard** — You can’t accidentally send to a transparent address or expose amounts.
- **Trust is minimal** — You hold the keys; the server only helps with blocks and broadcasting, not with decrypting your wallet or seeing your balance.

Nozy is built for people who want Zcash to behave like a privacy coin: fast, cheap, SOV and private every time.

***

#### What it is not for

Nozy is not for:

- Transparent (t-address) sends or receives
- Exchanges or services that only support t-addresses
- Users who need legacy Sapling-only tooling without Orchard

For those cases, use a wallet that supports transparent or legacy flows. (e.g.; Zashi, Zkool, Zingo)
