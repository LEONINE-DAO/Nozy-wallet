NozyWallet is a privacy-first Zcash wallet that shows you what you need: your balance, ZEC price, and your private transactions. Today it’s a wallet; over time it will add swaps and other features—all built on the same foundation: shielded-only, self-custodial ZEC.

#### What Nozy is

- **A wallet** — Create and restore wallets, manage Orchard addresses, send and receive ZEC.
- **Privacy-first** — Shielded-only; no transparent addresses, no optional privacy.
- **Zebra-first** — Designed to work with a Zebra RPC node as the chain backend.
- **Self-custodial** — Your seed and keys stay on your device; the API server does not see them.
- **Price-aware** — ZEC price is shown so you know the value of your holdings; trading features are planned.

It is built to sit next to your ZEC, keep it private, and let you move it—or later, trade it—when you decide, without leaking who you are, who you pay, or how much.

#### What Nozy is not

- **Not a mixer** — It doesn’t mix other people’s coins; it keeps your own activity shielded.
- **Not a custodial service** — You hold the keys; no one else can move your funds or see your balance.
- **Not a social or signal product** — No groups, no tips, no public profiles; focus stays on your private ZEC.

Everything about it is built for private, self-custodial ZEC—with price visibility today and more features to come.
