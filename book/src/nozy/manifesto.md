# NozyWallet Manifesto

***

**NozyWallet** is a privacy-first Zcash wallet that enforces complete transaction privacy by default. Unlike other Zcash wallets, NozyWallet **only supports shielded transactions** — making it functionally equivalent to Monero in terms of privacy, but with faster block times and lower fees.

"Cyberpunk" describes activists, coders, and thinkers who advocate for strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to enable social and political change — basically, using code to protect individual freedom from surveillance by governments or corporations.

*Freedom is privacy; without it we are in a Bridewell of surveillance.*
