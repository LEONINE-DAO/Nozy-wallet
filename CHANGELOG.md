# Changelog

## [2.3.0] — Priority Lane (2026-06-03)

### Added

- **Dynamic fee pilot (Phase A1):** client-side ZIP-317 conventional fees for Orchard sends
- CLI `nozy send --priority` — opt-in fee multiplier ×4 (Shielded Labs pilot alignment)
- Short transaction expiry (~2 blocks from chain tip at build time)
- Desktop and api-server: priority flag on send and live fee estimates (replaces hardcoded slow/normal/fast ZEC amounts)

### Changed

- Send flows no longer rely on Zebrad `estimatefee` (unimplemented; previously fell back to 10_000 zats)
- `transaction_history` records `priority` and `expiry_height` on pilot sends

### Not in this release

- Extension WASM fee alignment, expired-tx polling, speed-up rebuild, Zeaking-shared `fee_policy` (see [docs/rfcs/DYNAMIC_FEE_PHASE_A_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/rfcs/DYNAMIC_FEE_PHASE_A_IMPLEMENTATION.md))
